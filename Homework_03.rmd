1. The first task was to change this text:
```
First String    Second      1.22      3.4
Second          More Text   1.555555  2.2220
Third           x           3         124
```
such that it was in a `.csv` format, like this:
```
First String,Second,1.22,3.4
Second,More Text,1.555555,2.2220
Third,x,3,124
```

To do this, I used the Regex commands noted below. The `\s{2,}` expression returns 2 or more consecutive spaces, and the replace expression replaces these spaces with a comma.

```
FIND: \s{2,}
REPLACE: ,
```

2. Transform this:
```
Ballif, Bryan, University of Vermont
Ellison, Aaron, Harvard Forest
Record, Sydne, Bryn Mawr
```
into this:
```
Ballif Bryan (University of Vermont)
Ellison Aaron (Harvard Forest)
Record Sydne (Bryn Mawr)
```
To accomplish this transformation, I wrote a regex that would highlight each line. Then, I captured each segment that I wanted to keep (first word, a space + second word, and the last phrase). My replace command included these captures with a space added after the second word and parantheses around the third capture.

```
FIND: (\w+),(\s\w+),\s(.*)
REPLACE: \1\2 (\3)
```

3. Transform
```
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3 0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3 0003 Cherokee Shuffle.mp3 0004 Walking Cane.mp3
```
to
```
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3
0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3
0003 Cherokee Shuffle.mp3
0004 Walking Cane.mp3
```

I captured the end of each to-be row with a search for `p3`, while also highlighting the space after capture. In the replace command, I kept the captured row ending, but replaced the space after each with a new line.

```
FIND: (p3)\s
REPLACE: \1\n
```

4. Transform the output from the previous question into:
```
Georgia Horseshoe_0001.mp3
Billy In The Lowground_0002.mp3
Cherokee Shuffle_0003.mp3
Walking Cane_0004.mp3
```

Here I wrote a regex to highlight each row in a way that enabled me to capture three components: the number at the beginning of each row, the name of each song, and the .mp3 file ending (with the `\n` character included). In my replace command I included each of these components in the correct order with and underline separating the song name and corresponding number.

```
FIND: (\d+)\h([^.]+)(.*)
REPLACE: \2_\1\3
```

5. Transform:
```
Camponotus,pennsylvanicus,10.2,44
Camponotus,herculeanus,10.5,3
Myrmica,punctiventris,12.2,4
Lasius,neoniger,3.3,55
```
to
```
C_pennsylvanicus,44
C_herculeanus,3
M_punctiventris,4
L_neoniger,55
```

Think I'm finally catching on to the strategy here. Again for the find expression I highlighted each line in parts, capturing the parts I would need for the replace command. In said command I had the first capture, which was the first letter of the genus, followed by an underscore and the second capture, which was the species name and a comma. Finally the third capture included the second integer value and the new line character.

```
FIND: (\w)\w+,(\w+,)\d+.\d,(.*)
REPLACE: \1_\2\3
```
